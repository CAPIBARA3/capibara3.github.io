**Last Updated:** November 23, 2025
**Status:** Draft
**Applies to:** All members, contributors, and external collaborators

---

## 1. Purpose and Scope

The purpose of this document is to define how intellectual property (IP) is managed, licensed, and distributed within the CAPIBARA Collaboration. This policy applies to all repositories, code, hardware designs, data, documentation, and creative works developed under the CAPIBARA name or using collaboration infrastructure.

This policy ensures:

* Openness and scientific reproducibility
* Legal clarity for contributors and external users
* Protection of contributor rights
* Compliance with international open science standards
* Consistent licensing across all outputs

## 2. Default Licensing Model — Summary

| Asset Type                                   | Default License             | Notes                                 |
| -------------------------------------------- | --------------------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| Software / Code                              | **BSD-3-Clause**            | Permissive, attribution-only          |
| Hardware                                     | **CERN-OHL-P (Permissive)** | OSHW-compliant, patent-safe           |
| Raw Data (measurements, telemetry, datasets) | **CC0 1.0 Universal**       | Public-domain equivalent              |
| Documentation / Papers / Diagrams            | **CC-BY 4.0**               | Attribution required                  |
| Logos, branding, name                        | All rights reserved         | Must not be reused without permission |

> **Public-by-default rule:** All collaboration outputs *must* be open unless there is an explicit written justification for temporary private status (embargo, immature draft, confidential information, competition concerns, etc.).

## 3. Contributor Expectations & Copyright Ownership

### 3.1 Contributors Retain Copyright

All individual contributors retain copyright to their work. By contributing, they grant the collaboration and the public the right to use the work under the corresponding license.

No contributor is required to transfer ownership to the collaboration.

### 3.2 Contributor License Agreement (CLA)

Contributing to any repository implies agreement to the license posted in that repository.

By contributing, you affirm that:

1. The contribution is your own original work OR compatible with chosen license
2. You have the right to grant it
3. You agree to release it under the collaboration's licensing policy

---

## 4. Attribution Requirements

### Legal attribution (BSD-3, CC-BY)

Must include:

* Copyright notices
* License text
* Credits

### Ethical attribution (CC0 data)

Even though CC0 does *not legally require attribution*, users **must** follow scientific norms and cite the CAPIBARA Collaboration in publications and derivative works.

Recommended citation text will be provided in data releases.

---

## 5. Patents and Inventions

The collaboration encourages open science and discourages patenting where possible.

If a contributor creates a patentable invention:

* They must disclose it to the Steering Committee
* They may choose to patent it themselves
* If patented, they must grant the collaboration a perpetual, royalty-free license to use it for research

Hardware under **CERN-OHL-P** already includes patent-safe licensing language.

---

## 6. Repository Rules

Every repository must include:

* LICENSE
* README
* CONTRIBUTING.md (if accepting contributions)
* CITATION.cff (if applicable)

Private repos must follow the same rules and eventually become public *unless formally exempted*.

---

## 7. External Collaboration & Dependencies

External code, data, or hardware may only be included if:

* License is compatible
* Copyright is respected
* Attribution is preserved
* It is documented in the README

Forbidden:

* “License laundering” (relicensing incompatible code)
* Copying proprietary code
* Using IP without permission

---

## 8. Generated Code, AI-Assisted Content, and LLMs

When using AI tools:

* Contributors must ensure copyright compatibility
* No proprietary training data may be introduced
* All generated code still falls under the repository license

---

## 9. Branding & Naming

The words **“CAPIBARA Collaboration”**, logos, and project designations are protected. Reuse is allowed only with explicit permission from the Steering Committee.

---

## 10. Changes to this Policy

Changes require:

* Proposal via GitHub issue or pull request
* Review by Steering Committee
* Approval by the PI or equivalent governing body
* Version bump and changelog

---

## 11. Contact

For licensing questions, email: **[your collaboration contact email]**
or open an issue in the **capibara-governance** repo (recommended).
