# About

## Structure

Here's to the structure of the CAPIBARA Collaboration:

* Parent organisation: The CAPIBARA Collaboration
    * CAPIBARA-CRD: Cosmic Ray Detector Pathfinder. Led by Lluc Soler (in collaboration with OBA Space FARADAY and its partners, and PLD Space)
    * CAPIBARA-COSMOS: High-energy astrophysics program. Led by Joan Alcaide Núñez

## GitHub naming strategy and organisation:
The CAPIBARA Collaboration organisation ([github.com/capibara3](https://github.com/capibara3)) is sub-divided into the CAPIBARA-CRD and CAPIBARA-COSMOS teams. Each team has it's own discussions, repositories, and projects which are named following "crd-name" or "cosmos-name". There are some collaboration-wide repositories (`.github` and `.github-private`) and some discussions as well for collaboration administration.
