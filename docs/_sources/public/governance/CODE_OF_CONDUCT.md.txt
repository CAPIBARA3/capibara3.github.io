# Code of Conduct

> Adapted from the Contributor Covenant, version 2.1

## TL;DR

**Be kind, be respectful, be professional.** We're a small student collaboration learning together. Treat others how you'd want to be treated. If someone's being hurtful or inappropriate, tell a Programme Lead.

---

## Our Pledge

We pledge to make CAPIBARA a harassment-free, welcoming experience for everyone, regardless of age, background, disability, ethnicity, gender identity, experience level, education, nationality, appearance, race, religion, or sexual orientation.

We're here to do science and learn together—let's make it positive and inclusive.

## Our Standards

Examples of behavior that contributes to a positive environment for our community include:

* Demonstrating empathy and kindness toward other people
* Being respectful of differing opinions, viewpoints, and experiences
* Giving and gracefully accepting constructive feedback
* Accepting responsibility and apologizing to those affected by our mistakes, and learning from the experience
* Focusing on what is best not just for us as individuals, but for the overall community

Examples of unacceptable behavior include:

* The use of sexualized language or imagery, and sexual attention or advances of any kind
* Trolling, insulting or derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks
* Public or private harassment
* Publishing others' private information, such as a physical or email address, without their explicit permission
* Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting
* Discrimination based on personal characteristics or beliefs
* Intimidation or bullying
* Unwelcome sexual attention or advances
* Advocating for, or encouraging, any of the above behavior

## Special Protections for Minors

Given our educational mission and inclusion of student researchers under 18, we have additional protections:

* **No Private Communication:** Members shall not initiate private one-on-one communication with minors
* **Group Settings:** All communications with minors should occur in group settings
* **Parental Involvement:** Parents/guardians may request oversight of communications
* **Reporting Mandate:** Any concerning behavior involving minors must be reported immediately to the Steering Committee
* **Extra Caution:** Be especially mindful of language and content when minors are present

## Enforcement Responsibilities

Programme Leads and senior members are responsible for enforcing these standards. They'll take fair action if behavior is inappropriate, threatening, or harmful.

This includes removing/editing problematic comments, commits, code, issues, or other contributions—with explanation when appropriate.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies everywhere we interact as CAPIBARA members:
- GitHub (issues, PRs, discussions, comments)
- Email and video calls
- Conferences or events where you represent CAPIBARA
- Anywhere you're acting as a CAPIBARA member

**Important**: This applies even in "informal" spaces like WhatsApp if you're discussing CAPIBARA work.

## Reporting Problems

### If Someone Violated This Code

**Report to**: [internal contact](https://capibara3.gihthub.io/internal-contact.html)

**Or contact**: Any Programme Lead directly

**Include if possible**:
- What happened (be specific)
- Who was involved
- When and where it occurred
- Screenshots or evidence (if you have any)
- Whether you want to remain anonymous

**We promise**:
- We'll acknowledge your report within 24 hours
- We'll investigate fairly and promptly
- We'll keep it confidential
- We won't retaliate against good-faith reports

### What Happens Next

1. **We acknowledge**: "Got your report, looking into it"
2. **We investigate**: Talk to people, gather facts
3. **We decide**: What happened and what to do about it
4. **We communicate**: Let you and the accused know the outcome
5. **Appeal option**: 7 days to appeal if you disagree

## Consequences

Community leaders will follow these Community Impact Guidelines in determining the consequences for any action they deem in violation of this Code of Conduct:

### 1. Correction

**Community Impact**: Use of inappropriate language or other behavior deemed unprofessional or unwelcome in the community.

**Consequence**: A private, written warning from community leaders, providing clarity around the nature of the violation and an explanation of why the behavior was inappropriate. A public apology may be requested.

### 2. Warning

**Community Impact**: A violation through a single incident or series of actions.

**Consequence**: A warning with consequences for continued behavior. No interaction with the people involved, including unsolicited interaction with those enforcing the Code of Conduct, for a specified period of time. This includes avoiding interactions in community spaces as well as external channels like social media. Violating these terms may lead to a temporary or permanent ban.

### 3. Temporary Ban

**Community Impact**: A serious violation of community standards, including sustained inappropriate behavior.

**Consequence**: A temporary ban from any sort of interaction or public communication with the community for a specified period of time. No public or private interaction with the people involved, including unsolicited interaction with those enforcing the Code of Conduct, is allowed during this period. Violating these terms may lead to a permanent ban.

### 4. Permanent Removal

**For**: Pattern of violations, sustained harassment, attacks on groups of people, or violations involving minors

**Consequence**: Permanently banned from CAPIBARA. Removed from all platforms. May be reported to authorities if illegal activity or minors involved.

**Special case**: ANY violation involving minor safety (like private messaging a minor) = immediate temp ban, likely permanent.

## Appeals

Think the decision was unfair? You can appeal:
1. Write to Programme Lead within 7 days
2. Explain why you think it's wrong
3. Get a final decision within 14 days

## We Protect Reporters

**If you report in good faith**, we will NOT retaliate, even if the report turns out to be unfounded.

**But**: Knowingly making false reports is itself a violation.

## Support for Targets

If you're the target of a violation:
- We'll support you
- We'll respect your wishes about involvement
- We'll help you avoid the violator
- We can connect you with resources if needed
