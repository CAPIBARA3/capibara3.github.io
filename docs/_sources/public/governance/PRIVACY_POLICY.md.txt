  - Personal data deleted within 90 days (if you request it)
  - GitHub contribution history stays (it's permanent)
  - You can stay listed as "Alumni" if you want
- **Emails**: Kept for 2 years then deleted

## Data Security

We protect your data by:
- Limiting access to private repositories to verified members
- Encouraging two-factor authentication on GitHub
- Using encrypted email when possible
- Not storing sensitive information unnecessarily

**But remember**: We're a small student group, not a company. We do our best but can't guarantee perfect security.

## If Something Goes Wrong

If there's a data breach affecting your information:
- We'll email you within 72 hours
- For minors: we'll contact parents/guardians within 24 hours
- We'll explain what happened and what to do

## Cookies and Website Tracking

Our website (GitHub Pages) doesn't use cookies for tracking or advertising. GitHub may collect basic anonymous analytics about page views.

## Changes to This Policy

If we update this policy:
- **Major changes**: We'll email everyone and give 30 days notice
- **Minor changes**: We'll post updates on GitHub
- Staying in the collaboration means you accept the updated policy

## International Members

CAPIBARA has members worldwide. Your data might be:
- Stored on US servers (GitHub, Microsoft)
- Accessed by members in other countries

We follow GDPR principles as a baseline, even though we're not a formal EU organization.
