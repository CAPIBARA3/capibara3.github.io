# Governance

Welcome to CAPIBARA's governance docs! We're a small (~10 student) informal research collaboration. These documents explain how we work together, make decisions, and treat each other fairly.

**New here?** Start with the [Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) and [Membership Guide](MEMBERSHIP_POLICY.md).

**TL;DR**: Be respectful, contribute when you can, give credit fairly, keep unpublished stuff private. Questions? Just ask!

## About CAPIBARA

CAPIBARA is an informal student collaboration working on:
- **CAPIBARA-CRD**: Cosmic ray detectors (led by Lluc Soler)
- **CAPIBARA-COSMOS**: High-energy astrophysics (led by Joan Alcaide Núñez)

We're learning by doing: planning ideas, building instruments, analyzing data, publishing updates, and gaining real research experience.

## Core Principles

🔬 **Open Science**: Default to open source and public data  
🎓 **Student-Led**: Students make decisions and lead projects  
🌍 **International**: Members from around the world  
🤝 **Collaborative**: Help each other learn and succeed  
⚖️ **Fair**: Everyone gets appropriate credit for their work

## How We Work

**Decision-making**: Programme Leads handle day-to-day stuff; big decisions need group discussion/consensus (~2/3 agreement)

**Membership**: Apply through website → brief chat → join GitHub → start contributing

**Meetings**: Monthly video calls (time zones permitting) + async work on GitHub

**Publications**: Fair authorship based on contribution (see [Authorship Policy](AUTHORSHIP_POLICY.md))

## Need Help?

* **General questions**: Post in [GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/capibara3/discussions)
* **Code of Conduct concerns**: [Email](https://capibara3.github.io/internal-contact.html)
* **Membership questions**: See [how to apply](../onboarding/00_applying_to_join.md)
* **Policy questions**: Open an issue in `.github-private` repo or ask Programme Lead

## About These Policies

We're a small group learning as we go. These policies are meant to be:
- **Clear**: Understandable, not full of legalese
- **Fair**: Everyone knows the rules
- **Flexible**: Will evolve as we grow
- **Practical**: Actually usable by students

**Not sure about something?** Just ask! We're all learning together.
