# Authorship Policy
## Version 1.0 | Effective Date: January 1, 2026

## Why This Matters

Getting authorship credit is important for your career! This policy ensures everyone gets fair credit for their work.

## Types of Papers

### Technical/Instrument Papers

**Author list**: Everyone who contributed to that specific thing, alphabetically by last name

**Acknowledgment**: "for the CAPIBARA Collaboration" after the names

**Good for**: Hardware papers, software papers, methods papers

### Science Results Papers

**Author list**: "The CAPIBARA Collaboration"

**In the paper**: List everyone alphabetically (usually in an appendix or footnote)

**Writing team**: 3-5 people who actually write it (listed first)

**Good for**: Major discoveries, survey results, flagship papers

### Student Thesis Papers
**Your thesis work**: You're first author!

**Co-authors**: Your supervisor, people who helped significantly

**Acknowledgment**: Credit CAPIBARA for data/support

## Who Gets To Be an Author?

You should be an author if you made a **substantial contribution** to:

**Science/Technical Stuff**:
- Designed or built the hardware
- Wrote significant code or analysis tools
- Collected or processed data
- Did the actual analysis
- Came up with key ideas

**The Paper Itself**:
- Wrote sections of the paper
- Made key figures/tables
- Critical review that improved it significantly

**AND you must**:
- Read and approve the final version
- Respond to authorship invitation within 2 weeks
- Be accountable for your part

### What DOESN'T Count as Authorship Alone

- Just general supervision
- Providing standard resources (computer access, etc.)
- Minor comments or feedback
- Routine data collection without analysis
- Being there when it happened
- Getting funding (goes in acknowledgments)

## How We Decide Authorship

### For Small Papers (Most of Ours)

1. **Lead author proposes list**: "I think these people should be authors"
2. **Circulate to proposed authors**: "Are you in? Anyone we're missing?"
3. **Finalize list**: Within a week or two
4. **Write the paper**: Lead author + team
5. **Everyone reviews**: All authors read and comment
6. **Everyone approves**: All authors say "yes, submit it"
7. **Submit!**

**Timeline**: ~2-3 months total (varies a lot)

### For Big Collaboration Papers

1. **Programme Lead proposes**: "Let's write about X"
2. **Form writing team**: Call for volunteers, select 3-5 people
3. **Make author list**: Who's been active and contributed?
4. **Opt-in period**: Members opt in (2-3 weeks)
5. **Write draft**: Writing team writes it (~1-2 months)
6. **Collaboration review**: Everyone reads and comments (~3 weeks)
7. **Address comments**: Writing team revises
8. **Final approval**: Must get >50% to approve
9. **Submit!**

**Timeline**: ~4-6 months

## Author Order

### Alphabetical (Default)
Most of our papers list authors alphabetically by last name. Simple and fair.

### Contribution-Based (Optional)
If everyone agrees, we can order by contribution:
- **First author**: Did the most work
- **Last author**: Senior person/supervisor (common in some fields)
- **Middle**: Others by contribution

**We decide this together** before writing.

### For Collaboration Papers
- "The CAPIBARA Collaboration" as author
- Individual names listed alphabetically in appendix

## Student Thesis Work

### Using CAPIBARA Data for Your Thesis

You're allowed! Just:

1. **Ask first**: Email Programme Lead describing what you want to do
2. **Get approval**: Usually quick and easy
3. **Do your work**: Analyze, write thesis
4. **Acknowledge us**: Mention CAPIBARA in acknowledgments
5. **Share draft**: Let Programme Lead read it before defense

**Your rights**:
- You can publish first (we won't scoop you)
- You're first author on thesis papers
- CAPIBARA can also publish using the same data (with credit to you)

### Example Acknowledgment:
> "This work was conducted as part of the CAPIBARA Collaboration. Data was provided by CAPIBARA-COSMOS/CRD. I thank the collaboration members for their support, particularly [names]."

## The Writing Process

### Drafting
- Lead author or writing team writes first draft
- Share early drafts with team for feedback
- Iterate until it's solid

### Review
- Circulate to all proposed authors
- Give 2-3 weeks for comments
- Address comments or explain why not
- Multiple rounds if needed

### Approval
- Final version sent to all authors
- Need explicit "yes" from everyone
- Non-responders: send reminder, then may remove from author list
- Must approve within 2 weeks usually

## Disputes (Hopefully Rare!)

### If There's a Disagreement About Authorship:

1. **Talk it out**: Try to resolve directly
2. **Programme Lead mediates**: Looks at evidence, proposes solution
3. **Advisory Board**: If still stuck, advisors help decide
4. **Decision is final**: Made by Programme Lead with advisor input

**Prevention is better**: Discuss authorship early and often!

## External Collaborators

Non-members can be authors if:
- They contributed substantially
- Programme Lead approved the collaboration
- They follow our policies

## Adding/Removing Authors After Submission

### Before Acceptance
- Need really good reason
- All current authors must agree
- Must notify journal editor

### After Acceptance
- **Very hard** - journals don't like this
- Only for serious ethical reasons
- Requires journal and everyone's approval

**Bottom line**: Get the author list right BEFORE submitting!

## Acknowledgments Section

People who helped but aren't authors go here:
- Technical assistance
- Feedback and suggestions
- Facility staff
- Funding agencies (always acknowledge funding!)

**Template**:
> "We thank [names] for [what they did]. This work was supported by [funding]. We acknowledge use of [facilities/resources]."

## Conference Presentations

### Talks/Posters
- Include key contributors as authors
- Acknowledge "CAPIBARA Collaboration"
- Share slides afterward

### Proceedings Papers
- Follow same rules as regular papers (usually fewer authors for posters)

## Common Scenarios

### "I built the detector, but someone else used it"
- **You**: Author on the hardware paper (probably lead)
- **Them**: Author on the science paper using it
- **You on their paper**: Author if you helped with the analysis; acknowledged if you just built it

### "I wrote software, others use it"
- **You**: Author (probably lead) on software paper
- **Users**: Cite your software paper
- **Users' papers**: You're author if the software was crucial and novel; otherwise cited

### "Someone left mid-project"
- If they contributed significantly before leaving: still an author
- Must still review and approve
- If can't be reached after trying: may remove (document attempts)

## Data and Code Sharing

When you publish, you should:
- Archive raw data properly
- Make analysis code available (GitHub!)
- Include data availability statement
- Follow journal/funding agency requirements

Helps reproducibility and open science!

## Publication Tracking

We keep track of all CAPIBARA papers:
- List on website
- Celebrate publications!
- Use for progress reports
- Helps everyone's CVs

## Policy Violations

If someone:
- Excludes qualified authors
- Includes unqualified authors
- Bypasses review process
- Submits without approval

This violates [Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) and may result in:
- Correction of author list
- Retraction if serious
- Membership review
