# CAPIBARA Collaboration Agreement
## Version 1.0 | Effective Date: January 1, 2026

## What is CAPIBARA?

CAPIBARA is an **informal student research collaboration** focused on space science and high-energy astrophysics. We're a group of students learning by doing — building instruments, analyzing data, and doing real science together.

**Important**: This is not a legally registered organization. It's a volunteer collaboration of students and advisors working together on shared research interests.

## Key Definitions

- **Programme Lead**: Student leading a specific programme (CAPIBARA-CRD or CAPIBARA-COSMOS). Currently: Lluc Soler (CRD), Joan Alcaide (COSMOS)
- **Advisory Board**: Faculty or senior scientists who mentor us (voluntary, informal)
- **Member**: Anyone who's joined and contributes regularly
- **Active Member**: Someone who's contributed in the past 6 months
- **Consensus**: When most people (~2/3) agree on something important
- **Minor**: Someone under 18 years old

## How We're Organized

**Current Structure (~10 students)**:
- **Programme Leads**: Students who coordinate each project (CRD, COSMOS)
- **Members**: Everyone who actively contributes
- **Advisors**: Faculty/professionals who help when we need guidance

**Host Institutions**: Our home universities (currently informal partnerships)

## How We Make Decisions

**Day-to-day stuff**: Programme Leads decide or ask the team  
**Important things** (new policies, major changes): We discuss and vote if needed — usually aim for ~2/3 agreement  
**New members**: Programme Lead approves after application  
**Urgent matters**: Programme Leads decide and inform everyone

**Philosophy**: We try to be democratic but practical. With a small group, we mostly reach consensus through discussion.

## Intellectual Property (Open Science)

We believe in open science:

- **Software**: Open source (MIT or BSD-3-Clause license)
- **Hardware**: Open hardware (CERN-OHL-P-2.0 license)
- **Documentation**: Creative Commons (CC-BY 4.0)
- **Data**: Public after 6 months (gives us time to analyze it first)
- **Papers**: Must acknowledge "CAPIBARA Collaboration"
- **Branding**: CAPIBARA name/logo stays with the collaboration

**Why?** So others can learn from our work and we can learn from theirs.

## Changes to This Agreement

We can update this as we learn and grow. Major changes need discussion and general agreement (~2/3 of active members).

## Important Legal Stuff

**Disclaimer**: CAPIBARA is an informal student group, not a legal entity. Everything we provide (code, designs, data, documentation) is "as is" — we're students learning, so use at your own risk!

**Your Responsibility**:
- Follow your university's safety and ethics rules
- Get necessary approvals from your institution
- Be responsible for your own safety
- If you're under 18: work under appropriate supervision
- Have insurance through your university or family

**No Liability**: Since we're an informal group, there's no organization that can be sued. We're all just students collaborating voluntarily.

## Rules for Members Under 18

If you're under 18, your parent/guardian must:
- Complete the [Parental Consent Form](PARENTAL_CONSENT_FORM.md)
- Be okay with you participating in online research activities
- Understand the time commitment (~2 hours/week)

**Safety rules**:
- No private chats between adults and minors (all communication in groups)
- Parents can observe any meetings/activities
- Parents can withdraw consent anytime

**Why?** To keep everyone safe and make sure parents know what their kids are doing.

## Governing Law

Since we're international and informal:
- We try to follow GDPR principles for privacy (good baseline)
- You're responsible for following your own country's/institution's laws
- If there are disputes, we talk them out (see [Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md))

## Leaving the Collaboration

**Voluntary**: You can leave anytime — just let the Programme Lead know. We'll:
- Remove your GitHub access within a week
- Handle any in-progress authorship fairly (see [Authorship Policy](AUTHORSHIP_POLICY.md))
- Delete your personal data if you want (see [Privacy Policy](PRIVACY_POLICY.md))
- You can stay listed as "Alumni" if you'd like

**Being Removed**: If someone seriously violates the [Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) or [Membership Policy](MEMBERSHIP_POLICY.md), they may be removed. See those policies for details.

## Confidentiality

**Keep private**:
- Unpublished results (until we publish them)
- Internal discussions and disagreements
- Other people's personal information
- Anything explicitly marked "don't share"

**OK to share**:
- Public GitHub stuff
- Published papers
- Your own work (with proper attribution)
- General info about the collaboration

**With your advisor**: It's fine to discuss your work with your supervisor/advisor.

## What If the Collaboration Ends?

If CAPIBARA ever dissolves (hopefully not!):
- Public GitHub repos stay public forever (that's how GitHub works)
- We'll archive our work appropriately
- Personal data gets deleted
- In-progress papers get finished or properly attributed

## Related Policies

This agreement works together with:
- [Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) — How we treat each other
- [Membership Policy](MEMBERSHIP_POLICY.md) — Joining and participation
- [Authorship Policy](AUTHORSHIP_POLICY.md) — Credit for papers
- [Privacy Policy](PRIVACY_POLICY.md) — Your data
- [Communications Policy](COMMUNICATIONS_POLICY.md) — Staying in touch

Read all of them — they're designed to be clear and fair.
