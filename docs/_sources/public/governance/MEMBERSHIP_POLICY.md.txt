## What's Expected

### All Members Should:
✅ **Be respectful**: Follow [Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md)  
✅ **Communicate**: Let us know if you'll be inactive  
✅ **Contribute**: Do something (code, analysis, documentation, ideas...)  
✅ **Document**: Write down what you did  
✅ **Participate**: Join meetings when you can  

### Time Commitment
- **Minimum**: ~2 hours/week average
- **Reality**: Some weeks more, some weeks zero (exams, life, etc.)
- **If inactive**: Let us know! We understand student life

**Quality over quantity** - an hour of focused work beats 10 hours of distraction.

## Staying Active

**Active  = contributed in past 6 months**

Contributions count as:
- Code commits

- Let us know if you're taking a break
- We might move you to "Alumni" after 12 months
- You can always come back

## If Things Aren't Working Out

### You Want to Leave
No problem! Just:
1. Email the Programme Lead
2. We'll wrap up any in-progress work
3. Remove GitHub access
4. Handle data per [Privacy Policy](PRIVACY_POLICY.md)
5. You can stay listed as "Alumni"

**No hard feelings** - student life is busy and priorities change!

### We Need to Remove Someone

This **rarely** happens, but if someone:
- Violates [Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) seriously
- Is completely inactive without communication (12+ months)
- Acts harmfully toward the collaboration

**Process**:

4. **Decision**: Programme Lead + 2 senior members review
5. **Removal**: If necessary, with clear reasoning

**Appeal**: Can appeal to Advisory Board within 14 days
