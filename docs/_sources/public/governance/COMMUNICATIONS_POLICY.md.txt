# Communications Guide
## Version 1.0 | Effective Date: January 1, 2026

## How We Stay in Touch

CAPIBARA is a distributed collaboration \u2014 we're in different time zones, universities, and countries. Here's how we communicate:

## Official Channels (Everyone Should Use)

### 1. GitHub (`CAPIBARA3` organization)
**What for**: Everything collaboration-related
- **Issues**: Bug reports, tasks, feature requests
- **Pull Requests**: Code and document changes
- **Discussions**: Questions, ideas, announcements
- **Projects**: Tracking what we're working on

**Why GitHub?** It's free, keeps a record, and everyone can see what's happening.

### 2. Email
**What for**: 
- Formal stuff (joining, leaving, important announcements)
- External communications
- Private matters
- Parental contact (for members under 18)

### 3. Monthly Video Calls
**What for**: Seeing each other, discussing progress, making decisions

**Schedule**: We agree on a time that works for most people (rotating to accommodate time zones)

**Notes**: Posted on GitHub after each meeting

## Informal Channels (Optional)

**WhatsApp/Discord/Slack**: Some of us use these to chat casually. These are NOT official, important stuff goes on GitHub or email.

## How to Communicate Well

### Response Times (Guidelines, Not Rules)
- **Urgent stuff**: Try to respond same day
- **Regular questions**: Within a few days  
- **Pull requests**: Review within a week
- **No pressure**: We're all students with exams, projects, life!

### Good Practices
- **Be clear**: Explain what you need
- **Be kind**: See [Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md)
- **Tag people**: @ mention if you need someone's attention
- **Search first**: Check if your question was already answered
- **English**: Use English for collaboration stuff (so everyone can understand)

## Sharing Our Work Externally

### Social Media
**Your posts**: You can share public CAPIBARA stuff! Just add: "Views are my own"

**Don't share**:
- Unpublished results (wait until we publish)
- Internal arguments or problems
- Other people's personal info
- Photos of minors without parental consent

### Conferences & Presentations
Want to present CAPIBARA work? Great!

1. **Tell the Programme Lead** at least 2 weeks before the abstract deadline
2. **Give credit**: Acknowledge "CAPIBARA Collaboration"
3. **Share slides**: Upload them to GitHub

### Media/Press
If someone from media contacts you:
- Forward to Programme Lead via [contact form](https://capibara3.github.io/contact)
- Don't make official statements on behalf of CAPIBARA
- You can talk about your own work (with proper attribution)

## GitHub Best Practices

### Issues
- Use descriptive titles
- Explain the problem/request
- Add labels if you can
- Close when done

### Pull Requests
- Describe what you changed and why
- Link to related issues
- Wait for review before merging
- Be patient \u2014 reviewers are busy too!

### Discussions
- Pick the right category
- Search before posting
- Mark helpful answers

## Meetings

### Monthly All-Hands
- **Agenda**: Shared a few days before
- **Attendance**: We track (for activity)
- **Recording**: Sometimes (announced in advance)
- **Notes**: Posted on GitHub

### Best Practices
- Join on time if you can
- Mute when not talking
- Video on if possible (but no pressure)
- Use chat for links/questions
- Stay on topic

## When Things Go Wrong

### Conflicts
If you have a problem with someone:
1. Try talking to them directly (nicely!)
2. If that doesn't work, talk to the Programme Lead
3. For serious issues, see [Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md)

### Violations
If someone is consistently unhelpful, rude, or ignoring communication standards:
1. **First time**: Friendly reminder
2. **Ongoing**: Programme Lead has a conversation
3. **Serious/repeated**: May affect membership (see [Membership Policy](MEMBERSHIP_POLICY.md))

## Tips for New Members

- **Don't be shy**: Ask questions!
- **Introduce yourself**: Say hi in GitHub Discussions
- **Watch for a bit**: See how others communicate
- **Start small**: Comment on issues before tackling big tasks
- **Ask for help**: We're all learning

## Accessibility

We try to be inclusive:
- **Time zones**: We rotate meeting times
- **Language**: English is expected, but we're patient with non-native speakers
- **Formats**: Share important info in multiple ways (written + verbal)
- **Accommodations**: Need something specific? Just ask!

## For Members Under 18

- **Group settings only**: Adults won't message you privately
- **Parents welcome**: Your parents can observe meetings
- **Questions**: Your parents can contact us anytime
