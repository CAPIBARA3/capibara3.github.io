# Authorship & Publication Policy (Draft v0.2)

**Status:** Draft for review
**Last Updated:** November 23, 2025
**Applies to:** All publications, public releases, presentations, posters, outreach, and conference submissions

---

## 1. Purpose

This policy ensures that contributions to collaboration outputs (papers, software releases, datasets, conference talks, etc.) are recognized fairly, transparently, and consistently.

Its goals are to:

* Protect students from being excluded or exploited
* Avoid authorship disputes
* Ensure professional standards are followed
* Clearly define who qualifies as an author vs acknowledgements
* Prevent unauthorized publications or public statements

---

## 2. Definitions

### “Publication”

Includes but is not limited to:

* Peer-reviewed journal articles
* Conference proceedings
* arXiv/e-print submissions
* Posters and talks
* White papers and technical notes
* Theses
* Public datasets with DOI
* Press releases representing the collaboration

### “Internal Note”

A non-public technical document shared inside the collaboration. These do NOT need authorship rules.

---

## 3. Authorship Eligibility Criteria

An author must have contributed substantially in at least one of the following ways (adapted from ICMJE and CERN guidelines):

✔ Conceptual design or scientific leadership
✔ Significant contribution to hardware, software, or data analysis
✔ Theoretical interpretation of results
✔ Development of methods or infrastructure central to the work
✔ Writing and revising the manuscript
✔ Active participation through the duration of the project

**Simply being a member, attending meetings, or performing routine tasks does NOT guarantee authorship.**

---

## 4. Authorship Order

The default recommendation is:

1. **First author:** Primary contributor (student allowed)
2. **Second author onward:** Major scientific contributors
3. **Last author (if applicable):** PI / Project lead / supervisory senior figure
4. **Collaboration author:** “CAPIBARA Collaboration” as group author, if appropriate

### Alternate models allowed:

* Alphabetical order (for large multi-author papers)
* Dual first authorship
* Joint corresponding authors (must be declared)

Collaborators must discuss authorship before writing and confirm before submission.

---

## 5. Acknowledgements

Acknowledgements must include:

* Non-author contributors
* Funding sources
* Institutional affiliations
* Any external support (advisors, mentors, labs)

Acknowledgements are required even for CC0 datasets.

---

## 6. Mandatory Internal Review & Approval

Before submitting any publication:

1. A draft MUST be posted to the relevant GitHub repo or internal forum
2. A minimum review period of **7–14 days** must be allowed
3. All authors must approve the final draft
4. The Steering Committee must give final approval
5. The publication must follow the Collaboration’s licensing policy

No member may publish collaboration results without review.

---

## 7. Student Theses

Students may freely use their contributions in:

* Bachelor’s theses
* Master’s theses
* PhD dissertations

They **must**

* Credit the collaboration
* Not include unreleased data without approval
* Submit thesis to the internal review process if collaboration-wide material is used

---

## 8. Dispute Resolution

If authorship disputes arise:

1. Resolve within the working group ➤ 1 week
2. If unresolved, escalate to Steering Committee ➤ binding decision
3. Severe misconduct may be referred to the Code of Conduct committee

Retaliation for raising authorship concerns is prohibited.

---

## 9. Use of the CAPIBARA Name

Members may not publish work “on behalf of the CAPIBARA Collaboration” unless:

* It has been approved
* It is aligned with collaboration research goals
* Authors include active members (unless stated as external)

Unauthorized use of the name is a serious violation.

---

## 10. Open Access Requirement

All publications must:

* Be posted on arXiv (unless journal prohibits)
* Be depositable in open access form
* Use collaboration-approved licenses when possible

Predatory journals are not allowed.

---

## 11. Revisions

Changes require:

* GitHub issue or pull request
* Discussion period
* Approval by Steering Committee + PI

---
