## 1. Install LaTeX

### macOS
1. Download and install **MacTeX**:
   - [https://tug.org/mactex/](https://tug.org/mactex/)  
   - (Large package ~4 GB, but includes everything you need.)
2. After installation, make sure the LaTeX binaries are in your PATH:
   ```bash
   echo $PATH


You should see `/Library/TeX/texbin`.

### Linux (Debian/Ubuntu)

1. Update your package list:

   ```bash
   sudo apt update
   ```
2. Install TeX Live (basic version):

   ```bash
   sudo apt install texlive-latex-base
   ```

   Or full installation (recommended, larger size):

   ```bash
   sudo apt install texlive-full
   ```

### Linux (Fedora/RHEL)

```bash
sudo dnf install texlive-scheme-full
```

---

## 2. Choose an Editor

You can edit `.tex` files with any text editor, but these are popular:

* **TeXShop** (macOS, included with MacTeX)
* **TeXworks** (lightweight, cross-platform)
* **VS Code** with [LaTeX Workshop](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=James-Yu.latex-workshop)
* **Overleaf** (online, no installation needed)

---

## 3. Create Your First LaTeX Document

Create a file named `paper.tex`:

```latex
\documentclass{article}
\usepackage[utf8]{inputenc}

\title{My First Paper}
\author{Your Name}
\date{\today}

\begin{document}

\maketitle

Hello, world! This is my first \LaTeX{} paper.

\end{document}
```

---

## 4. Compile the Document

### macOS

Using Terminal:

```bash
pdflatex paper.tex
```

### Linux

```bash
pdflatex paper.tex
```

After compilation, you’ll find `paper.pdf` in the same folder.

---

## 5. Collaborating with GitHub

LaTeX works well with Git since `.tex` files are plain text.

### Workflow

1. **Clone this repository**
```bash
git clone git@github.com:capibara3/papers.git
cd repo
```

2. **Create a branch**
```bash
git checkout -b your-branch-name
```

3. **Go to a directory and add your edits**
```bash
cd paper-title/
```

4. **Add and commit your changes**
```bash
git add paper.tex
git commit -m "Added introduction section"
```

5. **Push your branch to the remote**
```bash
git push origin your-branch-name
```

6. **Open a Pull Request (PR)** \
 6.1 If the PR does not delete or overwrite text → merge directly to update the main document. \
 6.2 If the PR deletes or changes someone else’s text → request their review and resolve merge conflicts before merging.

### Best Practices
* You may:
  * Create a new branch for each contribution or paper, OR
  * Reuse the same branch for ongoing edits.
* Always write clear commit messages (e.g., Added results section).
* Add a .gitignore file to keep the repo clean:
```
*.aux
*.log
*.out
*.pdf
```
* Consider using [GitHub Actions](https://docs.github.com/en/actions) to **auto-compile PDFs** on each push.

## 6. Extra Tips

* Use `latexmk` for automatic builds:

  ```bash
  latexmk -pdf paper.tex
  ```
* For bibliography management, install `biber` or `bibtex`.

✅ You’re now ready to write, compile, and collaborate on LaTeX papers across macOS and Linux!
