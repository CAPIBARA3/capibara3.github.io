## 1. Repository Workflow

### 1.1 Branching Strategy

* Main Branch (main): Production-ready code only
* Development Branch (dev): Staging area for all features
* Feature Branches: One branch per feature or bug fix
* Naming Convention:
	+ `feature/`: New features
	+ `bugfix/`: Bug repairs
	+ `hotfix/`: Critical production fixes
	+ `docs/`: Documentation updates

It is recommendable to identify a branch of yourself like `tag/username/branchname`.

### 1.2 Creating a New Branch (locally)

```bash
git checkout -b feature/new-instrument-module
```

### 1.3 Commit Changes

Stage changes:
```bash
git add <file>
# Or stage all changes
git add .
```
Commit with a descriptive message:
```bash
git commit -m "Added module for X-ray instrument calibration"
```

### 1.4 Push Changes

Push your branch to GitHub:
```bash
git push -u origin feature/new-instrument-module
```

## 2. Pull Requests and Code Reviews

### 2.1 Opening a Pull Request

* Go to the repository on GitHub
* Navigate to "Pull Requests" tab
* Click "New Pull Request"
* Select your branch
* Provide a clear, descriptive title and summary of changes

### 2.2 Review Process

* Minimum one team member review required
* The code owner (repo owner) must approve the PR
* Use inline comments for specific suggestions
* Check for:
	* Code quality
	* Documentation
	* Test coverage
	* Alignment with project standards

### 2.3 Merging Guidelines

* Squash and merge into development branch
* Ensure no merge conflicts
* Delete source branch after merging
* Update local repository after merge

## 3. Issue Management

### 3.1 Creating an Issue

* Navigate to "Issues" tab
* Click "New Issue"
* Use clear, descriptive templates
* Add appropriate labels and assignees
* Link to related pull requests or commits

### 3.2 Working on Issues

Reference issue number in commits:
```bash
git commit -m "Fix #42: Resolved gamma-ray detector calibration bug"
```

## 4. Best Practices

### 4.1 Commit Frequently

* Small, focused commits
* Clear, descriptive messages
* Commit working code

### 4.2 Branch Management

* Never work directly on main or dev
* Use feature branches
* Keep branches short-lived

### 4.3 Code Documentation

* Comment complex algorithms
* Maintain README files
* Document setup and usage instructions

### 4.4 Repository Maintenance

* Regularly sync your fork:
```bash
git fetch origin
git rebase origin/dev
```
* Remove merged/completed branches
* Keep dependencies updated
