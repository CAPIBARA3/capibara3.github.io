# **Welcome to Tutorials!** 🎓
## and if you are new, Welcome to the CAPIBARA Collaboration!

In this directory you can find different tutorials and guidelines which will help you code collaboratively following standard practices. This will enable straightforward collaboration, code sharing, and collective developing. This tutorials will help you setting up diverse tools in your computer, but they will not teach you how to code. Before even beginning to set up your computer, take a moment to familiarize yourself with our [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/capibara3/.github-private/blob/main/profile/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).

You will find information about **git** the most advanced and widely used version control software, **GitHub** the cloud-based service to share code and collaborate. As well as other recommendations and guidelines in terms of configuring your local machine. Before starting, you'll need access to a UNIX-based terminal.
