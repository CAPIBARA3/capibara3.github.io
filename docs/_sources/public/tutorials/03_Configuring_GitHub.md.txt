## 1. Why GitHub?
- Centralized repository for hosting code and project-related documentation and files
- Collaborationg through pull requests, issue tracking, and discussions
- Code review and CI/CD integration
- Enhanced project management tools and organisation administration
- Community and open-source collaboration features


## 2. Create a GitHub Account
- Sign up at GitHub, refer to this [website](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/start-your-journey/creating-an-account-on-github)
- Search our organisation ([capibara3](https://github.com/capibara3)) and join it. You can also text me your username and I'll add you.
- We will configure you team membership and you role in the organisation.
- To enable secure communication between your local machine and remote repositories, configure an SSH key (see [Configuring SSH Keys for GitHub](#configuring-ssh-keys-for-github) and [tutorial below](#configuring-ssh-keys-for-github))
- Set up two-factor authentication for additional security (optional, but recommended)


## 3. Useful Definitions

- **organisation:** A group of people or entities that collaborate on projects and share resources on GitHub.
- **repo (repository):** A central location where all the files, history, and metadata for a project are stored.
- **branch:** A separate line of development in a repository, allowing multiple versions of a project to coexist.
- **commit:** A snapshot of changes made to a repository, including a description of the changes and the author.
- **diff:** A comparison of the differences between two versions of a file or repository.
- **fork:** A copy of a repository, allowing users to experiment with changes without affecting the original.
- **pull:** To retrieve changes from a remote repository and merge them into the local repository.
- **pull request:** A request to merge changes from a forked repository into the original repository.
- **push:** To send changes from the local repository to a remote repository.
- **staging:** The process of preparing changes to be committed, including selecting the files and changes to be included.

I strongly encourage you to refer to [this video series](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL0lo9MOBetEFcp4SCWinBdpml9B2U25-f) created by GitHub to get you started to these commands.

## Configuring SSH Keys for GitHub

To configure SSH keys for secure access to your GitHub repositories, follow these steps:

1. **Generate a new SSH key**:
   ```bash
   ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "your_email@example.com"
   ```
   Replace `your_email@example.com` with your actual email address.

2. **Save the key pair**:
   You will be prompted to save the key pair. Choose a secure location, such as `~/.ssh/`.

3. **Add the SSH key to the ssh-agent**:
   ```bash
   eval "$(ssh-agent -s)"
   ssh-add ~/.ssh/your_key_name
   ```
   Replace `your_key_name` with the actual name of your SSH key.

4. **Copy the SSH key**:
   Copy the contents of the public key file (e.g., `~/.ssh/your_key_name.pub`).

5. **Add the SSH key to your GitHub account**:
   * Go to your GitHub account settings.
   * Click on "SSH and GPG keys" in the left-hand menu.
   * Click "New SSH key".
   * Give your key a label (e.g., "Laptop").
   * Paste the contents of your public key into the "Key" field.
   * Click "Add SSH key".

6. **Verify the SSH connection**:
   ```bash
   ssh -T git@github.com
   ```
   You should see a message indicating that you've successfully authenticated.

7. **Use the SSH URL for cloning repositories**:
   Instead of using the HTTPS URL, use the SSH URL to clone repositories:
   ```bash
   git clone git@github.com:username/repository.git
   ```
   Replace `username` and `repository` with your actual GitHub username and repository name.
