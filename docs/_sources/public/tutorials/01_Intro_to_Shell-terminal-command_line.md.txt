# **Intro to Shell/Terminal/Command Line** 🖥️

Welcome to the world of the shell! The terminal is a powerful tool that allows you to interact with your operating system using text commands. In this tutorial, we'll cover the basic concepts of using the shell and introduce you to some common commands that will help you navigate and manage files on your system.

If you're on **Windows**, please make sure you've installed Ubuntu on your machine. You can follow the instructions [here](https://github.com/CAPIBARA3/.github-private/blob/main/tutorials/Ubuntu_on_Windows.md) to get set up with a Unix-like environment.

## **1. What is the Shell?**

The shell, also known as the command line, terminal, or command prompt, is an interface that allows you to interact directly with your computer's operating system using text-based commands. It may look intimidating at first, but it’s a powerful tool that gives you control over your system.

In a terminal, you type commands to:

- Navigate the file system
- Create, move, and delete files and directories
- Install software packages
- And much more!

## **2. Opening the Terminal**

If you’re using macOS or Linux, the terminal should already be installed. You can open it by:

- **macOS**: Press `Cmd + Space`, type "Terminal", and hit `Enter`.
- **Linux**: Press `Ctrl + Alt + T` or search for "Terminal" in your application menu.

## **3. Basic Terminal Commands**

Here are some fundamental commands to get started. Try typing these into your terminal:

### **Navigating Directories**

- **`pwd`** — **Print Working Directory**: Shows the current directory you’re in.
  ```bash
  pwd

Output example: `/home/username`

- **`ls`** — **List**: Lists the files and directories in your current directory.
    ```bash
    ls
    ```
Output example: `Documents  Downloads  Pictures  Projects`

- **`cd`** — **Change Directory**: Changes the current directory.
    ```bash
    cd Documents
    ```
use `cd ..`to go up one level in the directory tree.

### **Managing Files and Directories**
- **`mkdir`** — **Make Directory**: Creates a new directory.
    ```bash
    mkdir my_new_directory
    ```

- **`touch`** - **Create Empty File**: Creates an empty file.
    ```bash
    touch myfile.txt
    ```

- **`rm`** — **Remove**: Deletes a file.
    ```bash
    rm myfile.txt
    ```

- **`rmdir`** — **Remove Directory**: Deletes an empty directory.
    ```bash
    rmdir my_new_directory
    ```

### **Viewing and Editing Files**
- **`cat`** — **Concatenate**: Displays the content of a file.
    ```bash
    cat myfile.txt
    ```

- **`nano`** — **Text Editor**: A simple text editor to edit files.
    ```bash
    nano myfile.txt
    ```

Press `Ctrl + X` to exit.
Press `Y` to confirm saving changes.


## 4. Using the `man` Command
Many commands in the terminal have built-in help. The man` command is used to open the manual (help documentation) for a command. For example:

```bash
ls
```

This will show detailed information about the `ls` command and its options.

## 5. Understanding the File System
In Unix-like systems, files and directories are organized in a hierarchical structure. Here’s a basic rundown of the common directories you may encounter:

* `/` — The root directory, the top of the file system.
* `/home/username/` — Your personal home directory.
* `/bin/` — Essential system binaries (programs).
* `/usr/` — User utilities and applications.


## 6. Permissions in the Terminal
You might see some commands fail or require elevated privileges. This is because files and directories in Unix-like systems have permissions. For example:

- **`chmod`** — Changes file permissions.
    ```bash
    chmod +x myscript.sh
    ```
- **`sudo`** — Execute commands as the superuser (administrator).
    ```bash
    sudo apt update
    ```
Note: You'll need to enter your password when using sudo.

## 7. A Few More Useful Commands
- **`clear`** — Clears the terminal screen.
    ```bash
    clear
    ```
- **`exit`** - Closes the terminal window.
    ```bash
    exit
    ```

## 8. Practice!
The best way to get comfortable with the terminal is through practice. Try using the commands above to navigate, create files, and explore your system. You can always use man `<command>` to get more information about any command.
