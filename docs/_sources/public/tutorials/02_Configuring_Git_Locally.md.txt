## 1. Why Use git?
- Version control for tracking changes in code and documentation
- Facilitates collaborationg with a clear history of changes
- Enables experimentation with features using branches
- Supports non-linear development through branching
- Seamless integration with GitHub


## 2. Install Git
1. Download Git: [Git Downloads](https://git-scm.com/downloads)
2. Follow the installation instructions for your operating system
3. Verify installation:
   ```bash
   git --version
   ```

## 3. Configure Git

Set up your name and email (these should be your GitHub credentials):
```bash
git config --global user.name "Your Name"
git config --global user.email "your.email@example.com"
```
Check configuration:
```bash
git config --list
```
You may also add further configuration and information, such as your editor or diff tool, if you want to customize your Git experience.
