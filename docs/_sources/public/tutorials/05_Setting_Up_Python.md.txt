## 1. Check for Pre-installed Python

Before you start installing Python, it’s good to check whether it’s already installed on your machine. Open your terminal and type the following command:

```bash
python --version
```

or for Python 3 specifically:
```bash
python3 --version
```
If Python is installed, you'll see an output similar to:
```bash
Python 3.10.0
```
If Python is not installed, you'll see an error message, and you can proceed with the installation steps below.

    ```bash
    /bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"
    ```

2. Once Homebrew is installed, you can install Python 3:
    ```bash
    brew install python
    ```
