## 1. What is Docker?
[Docker](https://docker.com) is a platform that uses containerization to allow developers to package applications and their dependencies into a standardized unit called a container. Containers are lightweight, portable, and can run on any system that has Docker installed.

## 2. Installing Docker
1. Download Docker Desktop for your operating system from [their website](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/)
2. Install following the instructions
3. Verify installtion running
```shell
docker --version
```

## 3. Basic Docker Concepts
1. Images: Read-only templates used to create containers. Images are built from Dockerfiles
2. Containers: Running instances of images. Containers are isolated and portable.
3. Dockerfile: A text file that defines the steps to create a Docker image.
4. Docker Hub: A repository where Docker images are stored and shared.

## 4. Basic Docker Commands
1. Check Docker installation: `docker info`
2. Search for an image: `docker search <image-name>`
3. Pull an image: `docker pull <image-name>`
4. Run a container: `docker run -it <image-name>`
5. List running containers: `docker ps`
6. List all containers: `docker ps -a`
7. Stop a container: `docker stop <container-id>`
8. Remove a container: `docker rm <container-id>`
9. List docker images: `docker images`
10. Remove an image: `docker rmi <image-name>`

## 5. Creating a Dockerfile
Create a file running `touch <dockerfilename>`and write it like:
```dockerfile
# Use the official Python image from the Docker Hub
FROM python:3.9

# Set the working directory in the container
WORKDIR /<your-directory>

# Copy the requirements file into the container
COPY requirements.txt .

# Install the dependencies
RUN pip install --no-cache-dir -r requirements.txt

# Copy the rest of your application code
COPY . .

# Command to run your application
CMD ["python", "your_script.py"]
```

## 6. Building and Running the Image
```shell
docker build t <image-name> .
```

```shell
docker run -it <image-name> <command-to-run>
```
```shell
docker run -it dockerfile python new_script.py
```
