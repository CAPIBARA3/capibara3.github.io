## 2. Key Differences

| Code Editors | IDEs |
|---|---|
| Lightweight | Occupy more local storage |
| Basic features for writing code | More comprehensive |
| Limits to syntax highlighting and auto-completion | Project management, debugging, version control, integration |
| Limited customization options | Highly customizable with plugins and extensions |
| Easy to learn and use | Steeper learning curve due to additional features |
| Limited support for multiple languages | Support for multiple programming languages |
| No project management features | Includes features like project templates, build automation, and deployment tools |
| No debugging tools | Includes debugging tools like breakpoints, code stepping, and variable inspection |
| No version control integration | Includes version control integration with Git, SVN, and other systems |

* Code editors are lightweight and provide basic features for writing code, such as syntax highlighting and auto-completion.
* IDEs (Integrated Development Environments) are more comprehensive and provide additional features, such as project management, debugging, and version control integration.

## 3. Choosing the Right Tool

- Consider the type of project you're working
- Consider the language you're primarily using
- Consider your OS
- Think about personal preferences and workflow
- Experiment with different options to find the one that works best for you.

## 4. Alternatives

Remember you can always use python notebooks in browser-based IDEs like jupyter lab or google colab. Additionally, you also can rely on online code editors like replit, ideone, or codepad.

Note: I haven't checked that all the recommendations are free, but most of them should be.
