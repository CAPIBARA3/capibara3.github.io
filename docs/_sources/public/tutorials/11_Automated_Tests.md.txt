# Automated Tests
Here you'll learn to write and run tests for Python using the `pytest` library, run `pip install pytest` to install it in your enviroment.

## 1. Create Testing Directory
Create a new directory for the test scripts inside your package's repository.
```shell
mkdir tests/
```

## 2. Create Test Scripts
```shell
touch tests/test<name>.py
```

## 3. Write Test Functions

### 3.1 Import Required Libraries
```python
import pytest
import <package-name> # to import your full package
from build.lib.<package-name> import <function> # to import a specific function
```

### 3.2 Write a Function
Testing functions must start with `test_`
```python
def test_<function-name>():
    # your function goes here
```

### 3.3 Example Usage
```python
import pytest
import my_package as mp

def test_addition_function():
	inp = (1,1) # input
	expected = 2
	out = mp.sum_function(inp) # output
	assert out == expected # assert evaluates the tested result with the expected result

def test_addition_function():
	inps = [(1,1), (2,5), (4,5), (3,8), (10,10)]
	expected = [2, 7, 9, 11, 20]
	for inp, result in zip(inps, expected):
		assert mp.sum_function(inp) == result

def test_addition_function():
	inp = ('1',3.5)
	with pytest.raises(ValueError, match="Both values must be integers."):
		mp.addition_function(inp)
		# pytest.raises enables to run a function and check the correct error is raised
```

## 4. Run Your Tests
To run the test, enter the following command to the shell:
```shell
pytest
```
You'll see if 'all test passed' or which tests failed and where.
