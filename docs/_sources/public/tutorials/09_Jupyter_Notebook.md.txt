## 1. What is Jupyter Notebook?
[Jupyter Notebook](https://jupyter-notebook.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) is an interactive coding environment that allows you to write and execute code in small, manageable chunks (called cells). It's particularly popular in data science and research fields because it lets you:
- Write code
- Run it immediately and see the results
- Document your work with explanatory text (using Markdown)
- Create visualizations like graphs or charts

Jupyter Notebooks are great for experimenting with ideas, running simulations, and documenting your entire thought process in one place.

## 2. Installing Jupyter Notebook
Before starting, we need to make sure you have Jupyter Notebook installed on your computer.

### 2.1: Install Python
You should have installed Python in [5. Setting Up Python](https://github.com/CAPIBARA3/.github-private/blob/main/tutorials/05_Setting_Up_Python.md). Make sure you have installed Python 3 (not Python 2).

### 2.2: Install Jupyter
Use `pip` (Python's package installer), open a terminal/command propmt and type:

```bash
pip install notebook
```

Once installed, you can start Jupyter by typing the following command:

```bash
jupyter notebook
```

This will open Jupyter in your web browser.

## 3. Creating Your First Notebook
1. Open a new terminal tab.
2. Type and run `jupyter notebook` for a single notebook or `jupyter lab` for the integrated view.
3. Jupyter will automatically open on your web browser.
4. In the file browser, click **New** (on the right side of the screen) and select **Python 3**. This creates a new notebook.

* The notebook will be saved in the directory where you have started jupyter.
* The notebook will use the conda environment where you have started jupyter.
* Alternatively, you can also open a `ipynb` file on VS Code.

## 4. Writing Code in a Notebook
Jupyter notebooks have different types of cells, but the most important ones are **Code Cells** and **Markdown Cells**.

- **Code Cells** allow you to write and execute Python code.
- **Markdown Cells** let you write text, add headings, lists, and even include LaTeX for mathematical formulas.

### 4.1 Writing Python Code
In the first cell, type the following Python code to print a message:

```python
print("Hello, world!")
```

To run the code, press **Shift + Enter**. You should see the output below the cell:

```
Hello, world!
```

This means that the code has been executed successfully!


### 4.2 Adding Text with Markdown
Now, let’s add some text to explain what the code does. To do this, change the cell type from **Code** to **Markdown**. You can do this by selecting the cell, then choosing **Cell Type > Markdown** from the menu or pressing `M` on your keyboard.

In the Markdown cell, write:

```
### Explanation:
- The variables `a` and `b` are assigned values 10 and 20.
- We then add them together and store the result in `sum_ab`.
- Finally, we print the result.
```

After typing this, press **Shift + Enter** to render the text in a readable format.

## 4.3 Plotting Graphs
In research, you often need to analyze data and visualize results. Jupyter Notebooks support plotting graphs using libraries like **Matplotlib**.

First, let’s install Matplotlib. You can do this by running the following command in a new cell:

```python
!pip install matplotlib
```

Now let’s plot a simple graph. In a new code cell, try this:

```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Data for plotting
x = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
y = [1, 4, 9, 16, 25]

# Create a plot
plt.plot(x, y)

# Add labels and title
plt.xlabel("X values")
plt.ylabel("Y values")
plt.title("Plot of Y = X^2")

# Show the plot
plt.show()
```

When you run this cell, you should see a simple plot showing the relationship between `x` and `y`.

## 5. Saving Your Notebook
Once you've finished writing your code and explanations, you can save your notebook. To save the notebook, click **File > Save and Checkpoint** or press **Ctrl + S** (or **Cmd + S** on Mac).

## 6. Practice:
1. Experiment with more Python code.
2. Try installing and using other Python libraries like **Numpy** (for numerical computing) or **Pandas** (for working with datasets).
3. Learn how to import and analyze real data (e.g., from a CSV file).
