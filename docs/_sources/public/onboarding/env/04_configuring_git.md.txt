# 04 Git

## Goal
To configure the Git version control software on your device, learn basic commands and how to use git.

## Prerequisites
- [02_setting_up_unid](02_setting_up_unix.md)
- [03_command_line](03_command_line.md)

## Steps

### 1. Introduction

**Why use Git?**
Git is the most widely used and best version control system in the world, including:

- Version control for tracking changes in code and documentation
- Facilitates collaborationg with a clear history of changes
- Enables experimentation with features using branches
- Supports non-linear development through branching
- Seamless integration with GitHub

### 2. Setup

Before starting you will need to download Git from the official website.

1. Download [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)
2. Follow the installation instructions for your operating system
3. Verify installation running `git --version` on your terminal

### 3. Execution

### 3.1 Configuring Git

Set up your name and email (these should be your GitHub credentials)

```bash
git config --global user.name "Your Name"
git config --global user.email "your.email@example.com"
```

You can check the configuration by running `git config --list`.

You may also add further configuration details and information, such as your editor or diff tool, if you want to customise your Git experience.

### 4. Git Commands

### 4.1 Basic Git Commands

* `git init`: Initializes a new Git repository in the current directory.
* `git clone [url]`: Clones a repository from a given URL.
* `git add [file]`: Stages a file for the next commit.
* `git add .`: Stages all changes in the current directory and subdirectories.
* `git commit -m "[message]"`: Commits changes with a meaningful commit message.
* `git log`: Displays a log of all commits made to the repository.
* `git status`: Displays the status of the repository, including staged and unstaged changes.

### 4.2 Branching and Merging

* `git branch [branch-name]`: Creates a new branch.
* `git checkout [branch-name]`: Switches to a different branch.
* `git merge [branch-name]`: Merges changes from another branch into the current branch.
* `git branch -d [branch-name]`: Deletes a branch.

### 4.3 Remote Repositories

* `git remote add [name] [url]`: Adds a remote repository.
* `git fetch [remote-name]`: Fetches changes from a remote repository.
* `git push [remote-name] [branch-name]`: Pushes changes to a remote repository.
* `git pull [remote-name] [branch-name]`: Pulls changes from a remote repository and merges them into the current branch.

### 4.4 Undoing Changes

* `git reset [file]`: Unstages a file.
* `git reset --hard`: Discards all changes and resets the repository to the last commit.
* `git revert [commit-hash]`: Reverts a specific commit.

### 4.5 Other Commands

* `git diff`: Displays differences between the current version and the last commit.
* `git tag [tag-name]`: Creates a new tag.
* `git --all`: Displays a graphical representation of the commit history.


## Next Steps
Git allows you to organise and control your files and repositories on your local machine, but you are in a collaboration and will need to share your thoughts! That's why you should continue learning about [05_github](05_configuring_github.md).
