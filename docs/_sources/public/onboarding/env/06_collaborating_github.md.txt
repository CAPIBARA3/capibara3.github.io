# 06 Collaborating GitHub

## Goal

Learn the GitHub workflow and how to use GitHub’s features to collaborate, contribute, and communicate with the rest of the team.

## Prerequisites

- [02_setting_up_unix](02_setting_up_unix.md)
- [03_command_line](03_command_line.md)
- [04_configuring_git](04_configuring_git.md)

## 1. Introduction

GitHub is a powerful collaboration platform that integrates the tools a distributed, mostly asynchronous team needs to work effectively.

Because this topic is extensive, this tutorial does **not** follow the usual *Introduction → Setup → Execution → Verification* format. Instead, it is organized into these sections:

2. Repositories
3. Pull Requests
4. Issues
5. Discussions
6. Projects
7. Best Practices

---

## 2. Repositories

### 2.1 Branching Strategy

**Main Branch (`main`)**
Main, working, safe codebase.

**Development Branch (`dev`)**
Staging area for features before they move to `main`. Used in production repositories (e.g., published packages).

**Feature Branches**
One branch per feature, improvement, or bug fix.

**Naming Conventions**

* `feature/...` – New features
* `bugfix/...` – Bug fixes
* `hotfix/...` – Critical production fixes
* `docs/...` – Documentation updates

You may also tag the branch with your username, e.g., `feature/username/topic` such as `docs/joanalnu` or `fix-altfunc-joanalnu`.
**Note:** For the `capibara3/papers` repository, refer to the repository-specific guidelines.

---

### 2.2 Creating a New Branch

```bash
git checkout -b feature/new-instrument-module
```

---

### 2.3 Committing Changes

Stage changes:

```bash
git add <file>
# Or stage all changes
git add .
```

Commit with a descriptive message:

```bash
git commit -m "Add module for X-ray instrument calibration"
```

---

### 2.4 Pushing Changes

```bash
git push -u origin feature/new-instrument-module
```

---

## 3. Pull Requests (PR)

When you want to merge your branch into the main development flow, you create a **Pull Request (PR)**. PRs allow you and others to visualize changes, review code, discuss ideas, and request modifications.

### 3.1 Opening a Pull Request

1. Go to the repository on GitHub.
2. Open the **Pull Requests** tab.
3. Click **New Pull Request**.
4. Select your branch.
5. Provide a clear title and a concise summary of the changes.

Using GitHub CLI:

```bash
gh pr create
```

---

### 3.2 Review Process

* At least one team member review is required.
* The code owner (repo maintainer) must approve before merging.
* Use inline comments for specific suggestions or corrections.
* Reviewers should check:

  * Code quality and readability
  * Documentation updates
  * Test coverage
  * Consistency with project standards

Reviews help ensure quality and shared understanding. When reviewing or being reviewed, use GitHub’s discussion features constructively and collaboratively.

---

### 3.3 Merging Guidelines

* Prefer **Squash and Merge** into the development branch.
* Ensure there are no merge conflicts.
* Delete the source branch after merging.
* Update your local repository afterward.

Using GitHub CLI:

```bash
gh pr merge <PR_NUMBER>
```

---

## 4. Issues

Issues allow team members to report bugs, request enhancements, discuss features, or identify missing documentation—without needing to create a pull request immediately. A good issue is clear, concise, and includes all relevant context.

Issues can be linked to PRs, referenced from commits, and used as entries in Projects.

### 4.1 Creating an Issue

1. Open the **Issues** tab.
2. Click **New Issue**.
3. Choose a template when possible.
4. Add labels and assignees.
5. Link any related PRs or commits.

Using GitHub CLI:

```bash
gh issue create
```

---

### 4.2 Working on Issues

Reference the issue in your commits:

```bash
git commit -m "Fix #42: Resolve gamma-ray detector calibration bug"
```

---

## 5. Discussions

Discussions provide organization-wide communication for topics that benefit from open conversation: conference planning, funding applications, documentation questions, announcements, etc. They are organized into categories and should stay focused on a single topic per discussion.

Please follow the Code of Conduct and contribution guidelines. Read previous messages before posting, and stay engaged if you start or participate in a discussion.

---

## 6. Projects

Projects help teams plan, track, and reflect on work across multiple repositories. For each CAPIBARA mission, we maintain a Project that aggregates issues and work items.

Each card in a Project may represent an issue or a draft note. From within a Project, you can:

* open the issue
* edit its metadata
* track assignees and progress
* view discussions and linked PRs

Projects give a high-level view of the work happening across the organization.

---

## 7. Best Practices

### 7.1 Commit Frequently

* Use small, focused commits.
* Write clear, descriptive commit messages.
* Commit only working, coherent pieces of code.

### 7.2 Branch Management

* Never work directly on `main` or `dev`.
* Use feature branches.
* Keep branches short-lived to reduce merge conflicts.

### 7.3 Code Documentation

* Comment your code clearly.
* Keep README and other documentation up to date.
* Document setup, usage instructions, dependencies, and tests.

### 7.4 Repository Maintenance

Regularly update your local repo:

```bash
git fetch origin
git rebase origin/dev
```

Additional guidelines:

* Remove merged or closed branches.
* Enable security scanning and Dependabot in repositories.
* Close unupdated Issues and PRs

---

## GitHub CLI

If you want to use GitHub without constantly switching between your browser and terminal, consider installing the **GitHub CLI**. It provides an intuitive command-line interface for most GitHub features.

* Website: [https://cli.github.com](https://cli.github.com)
* Manual: [https://cli.github.com/manual/](https://cli.github.com/manual/)
