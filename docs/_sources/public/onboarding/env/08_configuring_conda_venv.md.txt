# 08 Configuring Conda & venv

## Goal

Learn how to create, activate, manage, and remove isolated Python environments using **Conda** and **Python’s built-in `venv`**. This ensures clean, reproducible setups for different projects without dependency conflicts.

## Prerequisites

- [02_setting_up_unix](02_setting_up_unix.md)
- [03_command_line](03_command_line.md)
- [07_configuring_python_pip](07_configuring_python_pip.md)



## Steps

### 1. Introduction

When working on multiple Python projects, you often need different versions of specific packages or Python itself. Environments are ways to separate versions of packages for different projects and keep different versions isolated. Conda is an environment manager which you can use to create and organise environments and packages inside them. Whiel `venv` stands for virtual environment and is created inside a project's directory and by using Python. It is a more lightweight version of conda environments, but it is distributed instead of centralised.


### 2. Setup

### 2.1 Install Conda

**Option 1 — Miniconda (recommended)**
A minimal, lightweight installer for Conda.

* Download: *[https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html)*
* Install using the instructions for your OS.

**Option 2 — Anaconda**
Includes Conda + many preinstalled data science packages.

* Download: *[https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual](https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual)*
* Install following your OS instructions.

### 2.2 Ensure Python is Installed (for `venv`)

Check Python version:

```bash
python3 --version
```

`venv` comes bundled with Python 3.3+.


### 3. Execution

### 3.1 Using Conda

**Create a new Conda environment**

```bash
conda create --name myenv
```

**Create a Conda environment with a specific Python version**

```bash
conda create --name myenv python=3.10
```

**Activate**

```bash
conda activate myenv
```

**Deactivate**

```bash
conda deactivate
```

**List all environments**

```bash
conda info --envs
```

**Remove an environment**

```bash
conda env remove --name myenv
```

### 3.2 Using Python `venv`

**Create a new environment**

```bash
python3 -m venv myenv
```

**Activate environment**

```bash
source myenv/bin/activate
```

**Deactivate**

```bash
deactivate
```

**Remove a `venv` environment**

Just delete the folder:

```bash
rm -rf myenv
```


### **4. Verification**

**Check active environment**

Conda:

```bash
conda env list
```

Active environment will be marked with `*`.

venv:

```bash
which python
```

It should point to the environment folder.

**Check installed packages**

```bash
pip list
```

## **Troubleshooting**

### Conda

| Issue                      | Cause                   | Fix                                                         |
| -------------------------- | ----------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- |
| `conda: command not found` | Conda not added to PATH | Restart terminal or reinstall Miniconda/Anaconda            |
| Environment not activating | Shell not initialized   | `conda init bash` (or zsh, fish, powershell)                |
| Packages won’t install     | Wrong channels          | Try `conda-forge`: `conda install -c conda-forge <package>` |

### venv

| Issue                                  | Cause                     | Fix                                                         |
| -------------------------------------- | ------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- |
| Activation script not working          | Missing permissions       | `chmod +x myenv/bin/activate`                               |
| `python` still points to system Python | Environment not activated | Re-run `source myenv/bin/activate`                          |


## **Next Steps**
You are ready to start working with environemnts, that's great! However, many times we want to share code among the collaboration and avoid the 'it-works-on-my-computer' problem. Environments are a tool to isolate package versions, but they are also heavy. That's why most of the repositories should have a `requirements.txt` file, specifing which package you need to install in a conda environment or `venv`. Anyways, there even is a more straightforward solution [16_docker](16_docker.md).
