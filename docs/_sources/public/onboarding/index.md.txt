# Onboarding

Welcome to the CAPIBARA Collaboration! This onboarding guide will help you transition from application to becoming a skilled software engineer and researcher. Whether you're a high school or university student with little-to-no coding experience, these tutorials will guide you step-by-step through installing tools, learning Python, collaborating with Git and GitHub, and contributing to real scientific projects.

Start with application, then move through environment setup, learn Python fundamentals, and progress to professional software engineering practices like testing and containerization.
