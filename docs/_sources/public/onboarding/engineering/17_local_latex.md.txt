# 17 Local $\LaTeX{}$

## Goal
- [02_setting_up_unix](02_setting_up_unix.md)
- [03_command_line](03_command_line.md)

## Prerequisites
- Basic collaboration account
- Installed environment

## Steps

### 1. Introduction

$\LaTeX{}$ is the most powerful tool for scientific writing, since it includes tons of packages and functions for math writing and diagrams/tables. It also is great for bibliography, and you can even write anywhere in $\LaTeX{}$ within markdown files: typing
```markdown
This is a markdown text with an inline equation: $E = mc^2$, and a block equation:
$$
E = \nu h
$$
```
will result in

### 2. Setup

### 2.1 macOS
1. Download and install **MacTeX**:
   - [https://tug.org/mactex/](https://tug.org/mactex/)  
   - (Large package ~4 GB, but includes everything you need.)
2. After installation, make sure the LaTeX binaries are in your PATH:
   ```bash
   echo $PATH


You should see `/Library/TeX/texbin`.

### 2.2 Linux (Debian/Ubuntu)

1. Update your package list:

   ```bash
   sudo apt update
   ```
2. Install TeX Live (basic version):

   ```bash
   sudo apt install texlive-latex-base
   ```

   Or full installation (recommended, larger size):

   ```bash
   sudo apt install texlive-full
   ```

### 2.3 Linux (Fedora/RHEL)

```bash
sudo dnf install texlive-scheme-full
```

### 2.4 Choose an Editor

You can edit `.tex` files with any text editor, but these are popular:

* **TeXShop** (macOS, included with MacTeX)
* **TeXworks** (lightweight, cross-platform)
* **VS Code** with [LaTeX Workshop](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=James-Yu.latex-workshop)

### 3. Execution

### 3.1 Create Your First $\LaTeX{}$ Document

Create a file named `paper.tex`:

```latex
\documentclass{article}
\usepackage[utf8]{inputenc}

\title{My First Paper}
\author{Your Name}
\date{\today}

\begin{document}

\maketitle

Hello, world! This is my first \LaTeX{} paper.

\end{document}
```

### 3.2 Compile the Document

Using Terminal:

```bash
pdflatex paper.tex
```

After compilation, you’ll find `paper.pdf` in the same directory.

Note that if you are using `bibtex` citations in your paper you will need to run:
```bash
pdflatex paper.tex # creates structure
bibtex paper # compiles citations
pdflatex paper.tex # adds citations to pdf
pdflatex paper.tex # ensures numbering and indexing is correct
```


## 4. Collaborating via GitHub

LaTeX works well with Git since `.tex` files are plain text.

### Workflow

1. **Clone this repository**
```bash
git clone git@github.com:capibara3/papers.git
cd repo
```

2. **Create a branch**
```bash
git checkout -b your-branch-name
```

3. **Go to a directory and add your edits**
```bash
cd paper-title/
```

4. **Add and commit your changes**
```bash
git add paper.tex
git commit -m "Added introduction section"
```

5. **Push your branch to the remote**
```bash
git push origin your-branch-name
```

6. **Open a Pull Request (PR)** \
 6.1 If the PR does not delete or overwrite text → merge directly to update the main document. \
 6.2 If the PR deletes or changes someone else’s text → request their review and resolve merge conflicts before merging.

### Best Practices
* You may:
  * Create a new branch for each contribution or paper, OR
  * Reuse the same branch for ongoing edits.
* Always write clear commit messages (e.g., Added results section).
* Add a .gitignore file to keep the repo clean:
```
*.aux
*.log
*.out
*.pdf
```
* Consider using [GitHub Actions](https://docs.github.com/en/actions) to **auto-compile PDFs** on each push.


## Troubleshooting
Visit the Overleaf website, they have some resources around $\LaTeX{}$ troubleshooting and errors. Rice University happens to also have some resources and guides around working with $\LaTeX{}$, like this summary of [basic math commands](https://www.cmor-faculty.rice.edu/~heinken/latex/symbols.pdf).

### Extra Tips

* Use `latexmk` for automatic builds:

  ```bash
  latexmk -pdf paper.tex
  ```
* For bibliography management, install `biber` or `bibtex`.
