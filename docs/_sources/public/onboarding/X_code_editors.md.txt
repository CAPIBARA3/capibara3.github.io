# Code Editors and IDEs

## Goal
Learn about different code editors and integrated development environments (IDEs), and how to choose one that fits your needs. We'll also show you how to set up a recommended editor (VS Code) with useful extensions for Python and Git development.

## Prerequisites
- [03 Introduction to the Command Line](03_command_line.md)

## 1. Introduction

A **code editor** is a tool where you write code. It's different from a text editor like Notepad because it understands programming languages and provides helpful features like:

- **Syntax highlighting**: Colors different parts of code (keywords, strings, comments) to make them easier to read
- **Auto-completion**: Suggests function names and variables as you type
- **Error detection**: Highlights mistakes before you run the code
- **Integration with Git**: Makes it easy to commit and push changes without using the terminal
- **Extensions/Plugins**: Add functionality for specific languages and tools

An **IDE** (Integrated Development Environment) is a more powerful version that also includes a debugger, built-in terminal, and project management tools.

## 2. Popular Options

### VS Code (Recommended for Beginners)
- **Type**: Lightweight Editor (can act like an IDE with extensions)
- **Cost**: Free and open source
- **Best for**: Python, web development, general coding
- **Pros**: Lightweight, huge extension marketplace, excellent Git integration, great for beginners
- **Cons**: Requires extensions to reach full IDE capabilities

**Install**: [code.visualstudio.com](https://code.visualstudio.com/)

### PyCharm
- **Type**: Full IDE
- **Cost**: Free Community Edition (or paid Professional)
- **Best for**: Python development, data science
- **Pros**: Powerful, built specifically for Python, excellent debugging
- **Cons**: Heavier than VS Code, steeper learning curve

**Install**: [jetbrains.com/pycharm](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/)

### Jupyter Notebook
- **Type**: Interactive notebook environment
- **Cost**: Free and open source
- **Best for**: Data exploration, scientific computing, teaching
- **Pros**: Great for learning, inline visualization, easy data exploration
- **Cons**: Not ideal for large software packages; hard to use with Git

**Install**: Included when you install Anaconda/Miniconda

### Sublime Text
- **Type**: Lightweight Editor
- **Cost**: Paid (with free trial)
- **Best for**: General coding, quick edits
- **Pros**: Fast, minimal interface, good for advanced users
- **Cons**: Less beginner-friendly than VS Code

### Vim / Neovim
- **Type**: Terminal-based Editor
- **Cost**: Free and open source
- **Best for**: Advanced users, remote servers
- **Pros**: Powerful, available everywhere, no GUI needed
- **Cons**: Steep learning curve, not recommended for beginners

## 3. Recommended Setup: VS Code with Python Extensions

### 3.1 Install VS Code
1. Go to [code.visualstudio.com](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
2. Download and install for your operating system

### 3.2 Essential Extensions
Open VS Code and go to **Extensions** (Ctrl+Shift+X / Cmd+Shift+X). Search for and install:

1. **Python** (Microsoft)
   - Essential for Python development
   - Provides intellisense, linting, debugging

2. **Pylance** (Microsoft)
   - Enhanced Python language support
   - Better code completion and type checking

3. **Git Graph** (mhutchie)
   - Visual representation of your Git branches and commits

4. **GitHub Pull Requests and Issues** (GitHub)
   - Manage PRs and issues directly from VS Code

5. **Jupyter** (Microsoft)
   - Run Jupyter notebooks directly in VS Code

6. **Better Comments** (Aaron Bond)
   - Color-code your comments for better organization

### 3.3 Configure Python Interpreter
1. Open a Python file or create one (`touch test.py`)
2. Press `Ctrl+Shift+P` (Cmd+Shift+P on macOS)
3. Type "Python: Select Interpreter"
4. Choose your preferred Python environment (from conda, venv, or system Python)

### 3.4 Configure Git Integration
1. Go to **View → Source Control** (or press Ctrl+Shift+G)
2. VS Code will automatically detect your Git repositories
3. You can now stage, commit, and push changes without leaving the editor

## 4. Basic VS Code Workflow

### Opening a Project
1. **File → Open Folder** and select your project directory
2. VS Code will recognize it as a workspace

### Writing and Editing Code
1. Create new files with **File → New File** or `Ctrl+N`
2. VS Code's intellisense will suggest completions as you type
3. Errors appear as red squiggles—hover over them for details

### Running Code
1. Open a Python file
2. Click the ▶ button in the top right, or press `Ctrl+F5`
3. Output appears in the Terminal pane

### Using the Terminal
1. Press `Ctrl+\`` (backtick) to open the integrated terminal
2. You can run commands without leaving the editor

### Using Version Control
1. Open **Source Control** (Ctrl+Shift+G)
2. Stage files by clicking the + icon
3. Write a commit message and press Ctrl+Enter
4. Push with **Push** button or from the Source Control menu

## 5. Verification

You can verify your setup is complete when:
- VS Code opens successfully
- You can create a new Python file and see syntax highlighting
- Intellisense suggests code completions as you type
- You can see your Git repositories in the Source Control panel
- You can run a simple Python script by clicking the ▶ button

## Next Steps

Congratulations! You now have a professional development environment. You're ready to write some code! While we're developing our own Python tutorial series, we recommend exploring the [Intro to Python](https://github.com/omsharansalafia/intropython) course to learn Python fundamentals before moving on to more advanced topics.
