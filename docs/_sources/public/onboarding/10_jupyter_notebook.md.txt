# 10 Jupyter Notebooks

## Goal
Learn how to use Jupyter Notebooks for interactive coding, data exploration, and scientific communication. Notebooks combine code, text, visualizations, and equations in a single document.

## Prerequisites
- [07 Configuring Python & Pip](07_configuring_python_pip.md)
- [08 Configuring Conda & venv](08_configuring_conda_venv.md)
- [09 Python Basics](09_python_basics.md)

## 1. Introduction

A **Jupyter Notebook** is an interactive environment where you run Python code in "cells" and see results immediately. Unlike regular Python scripts, notebooks let you:

- Write code in small chunks and run them independently
- Visualize plots and data directly in the notebook
- Mix code with formatted text (markdown), equations, and images
- Tell a story with your data analysis
- Share your work easily (notebooks are just JSON files viewable on GitHub)

Jupyter is widely used in scientific research, data science, and education.

## 2. Installation and Setup

### 2.1 Install Jupyter and IPython
Jupyter usually comes with Anaconda/Miniconda. If you need to install it:

```bash
pip install jupyter jupyterlab
```

### 2.2 Launch Jupyter
From your terminal, navigate to your project directory and run:

```bash
jupyter notebook
```

or for the newer interface:

```bash
jupyter lab
```

Your browser will open to `localhost:8888` showing your file browser. If you have VS Code, you can also run notebooks directly in the editor (see [X Code Editors and IDEs](X_code_editors.md)).

## 3. Notebook Basics

### Creating a New Notebook
1. Click **New** button and select **Python 3**
2. A new notebook will open with an empty code cell

### Cell Types

**Code Cells** - Contains Python code:
```python
x = 5
y = 3
print(x + y)
```
Run with Shift+Enter or the ▶ button.

**Markdown Cells** - Contains formatted text:
```markdown
# Section Title
This is **bold** text. Here's a [link](https://example.com).
```

### Writing and Organizing Cells

1. **Add a cell**: Click the + button in the toolbar
2. **Change cell type**: Use the dropdown (Code/Markdown)
3. **Run a cell**: Press Shift+Enter (runs and moves to next) or Ctrl+Enter (stays in cell)
4. **Delete a cell**: Press D twice

### Output and Variables

Variables persist across cells:

Cell 1:
```python
name = "Alice"
age = 25
```

Cell 2:
```python
print(f"{name} is {age} years old")  # Works! Prints "Alice is 25 years old"
```

## 4. Markdown in Notebooks

Use Markdown cells to document your analysis:

```markdown
# Main Title

## Subsection

This is regular text with **bold**, *italic*, and `code`.

### Lists
- Item 1
- Item 2

### Equations (LaTeX)
Inline equation: $E = mc^2$

Block equation:
$$
\int_0^{\infty} e^{-x^2} dx = \frac{\sqrt{\pi}}{2}
$$
```

## 5. Displaying Plots and Data

### Inline Plotting
```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

plt.plot([1, 2, 3, 4], [1, 4, 2, 3])
plt.xlabel("X axis")
plt.ylabel("Y axis")
plt.show()
```

The plot appears directly in the notebook below the cell.

### DataFrames
```python
import pandas as pd

data = {"Name": ["Alice", "Bob"], "Age": [25, 30]}
df = pd.DataFrame(data)
print(df)  # Displays as a formatted table
```

## 6. Magic Commands

Jupyter has special commands (starting with %) for convenience:

```python
# Show execution time
%timeit sum(range(100))

# Display plots inline (usually automatic)
%matplotlib inline

# Run a Python script
%run my_script.py

# List all variables
%whos
```

## 7. Keyboard Shortcuts

| Shortcut | Action |
|----------|--------|
| Shift+Enter | Run cell and move to next |
| Ctrl+Enter | Run cell and stay |
| A | Insert cell above |
| B | Insert cell below |
| D, D | Delete cell |
| M | Change to Markdown |
| Y | Change to Code |
| Ctrl+/ | Toggle comment |

## 8. Best Practices

### Organize Your Notebook
1. Start with a markdown cell describing the purpose
2. Import all libraries at the top
3. Use markdown cells to separate sections
4. Add descriptive comments to complex code

### Example Structure
```
[Markdown] Title and Overview
[Code] Import libraries
[Markdown] Data Loading Section
[Code] Load data
[Markdown] Data Exploration
[Code] Visualize data
[Markdown] Analysis
[Code] Perform calculations
```

### Checkpoint: Restart and Run All
Occasionally click **Kernel → Restart & Run All** to ensure your notebook works from scratch (not relying on out-of-order execution).

## 9. Sharing and Exporting

### Share on GitHub
Just commit your `.ipynb` file to Git. GitHub renders notebooks directly!

### Export to Other Formats
```bash
jupyter nbconvert --to html notebook.ipynb
jupyter nbconvert --to pdf notebook.ipynb
jupyter nbconvert --to python notebook.ipynb  # Convert to .py script
```

## 10. Troubleshooting

- **Kernel seems stuck?** Click **Kernel → Interrupt** or restart with **Kernel → Restart**
- **Variables not showing?** You might be in the wrong kernel (check top right)
- **Code not running?** Make sure you're in a Code cell, not Markdown
- **Import errors?** Make sure the package is installed in your active environment

## Next Steps

Now that you can run Python interactively, let's learn about powerful data and visualization libraries: [11 NumPy and Pandas](11_numpy_pandas.md).
