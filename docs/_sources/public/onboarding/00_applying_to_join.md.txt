# 00 Applying to Join

## Goal
Learn about the application process for joining the CAPIBARA Collaboration. This is not about the process of joining and onboarding, see the next tutorial [01_getting_started.md](01_getting_started.md)

## Prerequisites

- **Strong English communication** (oral/written) is required for collaboration and outreach.
- Be a **Student from any level**: from high school to PhD. CAPIBARA sends a strong message since it is fully run by students, and originally founded by high schoolers.
- Be **curious and interested** in a field(s). You don't have to contribute any expertise or know your field of study, but we recommend having an interest to pursue. Plus, it doesn't need to be STEM (astrophysics, physics, geophysics; mechanical, aerospace, electronic, software engineering, etc.), we are also looking for artists, social media creators, outreach writters...
- Be **motivated and passionate** in pursuing this project. Members have different levels of commitment subject to their personal lifes, but you should have a minimum time to interact with the community. Members typically dedicate 1-6 hours/week, but you can work at your own path corresponding with your status (e.g., exams, thesis writing, etc.).

Recommended, but **NOT** required at all: strong academic record, experience in a specific field, GitHub/coding knowledge (Python)

_If you don't know any or some of the previous skills, don't worry; you will learn them by us!_

## Steps

### 1. Introduction
You are a student that partially or totally fulfills the prerequisites stated above? Then you should apply to join the CAPIBARA Collaboration, an enthusiastic group of students who will soon be your collaborators and, perhaps, friends.

Note that in order to join the Collaboration y ou must fulfill a minimum set of requirements, which can be found in the [membership agreement](../governance/MEMBERSHIP_POLICY.md), in addition to those outlined above. These requirements are kept at a minimum for example "English communication", which is a basic for working in an international collaboration and particularly in research. There is no selection process or application process as such where the information of applicants is evaluated. Everyone who applies and fulfills these basic requirements can join, and we are happy to meet you!

### 2. Setup
You will need a browser and internet connection. You may want to have prepared a curriculum vitae (CV), motivation letter or other supporting documentation. The sharing of this documentation is absolutely optional, but it helps us getting to know you and getting started to work with you.

Before proceeding with the application itself, you may want to download a copy of the membership agreement and signit it. If you are under 18 years, you will additionally need the signature of at least one of your parents or legal tutors.

In the application form, you will need to provide key personal information and a contact. Then, we will get in touch with you and ask you for the documents mentioned before which you need to send after request via email to the official collaboration-wide email address as PDF files.

Once you open the application form link in the next step, please don't reframe from reading the "before applying" notice.

### 3. Execution
On your browser visit [capibara3.github.io/application-form](https://capibara3.github.io/application-form) and fill in all the required information and, if you want, the optional information. Then submit the form. You will find more information and the data privacy statement at the form itself.

### 4. Verification
In less than 10 working days, you should have received a confirmation email explaining the next steps and maybe inquiring more information. If you don't received this email, make sure to reach out to us. It may be that we didn't correctly receive you information or that we are simply too busy at the moment.

## Next Steps
Once you receive the confirmation email, you will proceed to joining the collaboration. Next step [01_getting_started.md](01_getting_started.md).
