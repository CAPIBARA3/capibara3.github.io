# 15 Automating Tests

## Goal
Here you'll learn to write and run tests for Python using the `pytest` library. With this you will automatise software tests and focus on solving the issues behind failed tests.

## Prerequisites
- [02 Setting Up Unix](02_setting_up_unix.md)
- [03 Introduction to the Command Line](03_command_line.md)
- [04 Configuring Git](04_configuring_git.md)
- [05 Configuring GitHub](05_configuring_github.md)
- [06 Collaborating on GitHub](06_collaborating_github.md)
- [07 Configuring Python & Pip](07_configuring_python_pip.md)
- [08 Configuring Conda & venv](08_configuring_conda_venv.md)
- [14 Creating Packages](14_packages.md)

## Steps

### 1. Introduction
`Pytest` is a Python package that simplifies writing and running tests. Instead of manually checking your functions after every change, you write automated tests that run instantly and tell you if something broke.

**Why do you need this?** When you're first writing code, you might test it manually by running it a few times. But as your codebase grows and multiple people contribute, it becomes impossible to manually test everything. Automated tests help you:
- Catch bugs before they reach users
- Ensure that when one person changes code, they don't accidentally break features that other people depended on
- Build confidence that your package works correctly
- Integrate with GitHub to automatically test every pull request before merging

Additionally, you can configure GitHub CI/CD to automatically run these tests, perhaps using a Dockerfile, creating a standardized testing environment across your team.

### 2. Setup
Before starting using `pytest` you will have to install it using `pip`:
```bash
pip install pytest
```

Also, in the repository where you want to conduct tests, you should create a new directory named `tests` in the root directory.
```bash
mkdir tests/
```

Inside that directory, you can create as many files for tests. For `pytest` to recognise them, they must start with `"test"`:
```bash
touch tests/test_<name>.py
```

### 3. Execution

### 3.1 Import Required Packages
```python
import pytest
import <package-name> # to import your full package
from build.lib.<package-name> import <function> # to import a specific function
```

### 3.2 Write a Function
Testing functions must start with `test_`
```python
def test_<function-name>():
    # your function goes here
```

### 3.3 Example Usage
```python
import pytest
import my_package as mp

def test_addition_function():
	inp = (1,1) # input
	expected = 2
	out = mp.sum_function(inp) # output
	assert out == expected # assert evaluates the tested result with the expected result

def test_addition_function():
	inps = [(1,1), (2,5), (4,5), (3,8), (10,10)]
	expected = [2, 7, 9, 11, 20]
	for inp, result in zip(inps, expected):
		assert mp.sum_function(inp) == result

def test_addition_function():
	inp = ('1',3.5)
	with pytest.raises(ValueError, match="Both values must be integers."):
		mp.addition_function(inp)
		# pytest.raises enables to run a function and check the correct error is raised
```

### 4. Verification
To run the test, enter the following command to the shell:
```shell
pytest
```
You'll see if 'all test passed' or which tests failed and where.

You can ses an example of pytest usage in the [capibara3/capicr-software](https://github.com/CAPIBARA3/capicr-software) repository.

## Troubleshooting
Check the official `pytest` [documentation](https://docs.pytest.org/en/stable/).

## Next Steps
Great you can now automatically test your code and share your tests with others! Next step is learning about [16_docker](16_docker.md) to also share your code's dependencies.
