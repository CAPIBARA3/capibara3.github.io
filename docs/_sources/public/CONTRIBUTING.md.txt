## 🐛 Creating a Good Issue

If you notice a bug or have an idea for a feature:

1. Check if existing issues to avoid duplicates have already addressed that.
2. If it doesn't exist, open a new using an appropriate template (or a blanck issue, if the repo has not templates).
3. Clearly describe the problem or suggestion, providing context, screenshots, and steps to reproduce (if applicable).

You can freely work on any issue that hasn't been assigned or that has asked for help. Remember to always notify this to the code owners (see the `CODEOWNERS.md` file in the repo) or to @joanalnu, so that the issue can be assigned to you.
