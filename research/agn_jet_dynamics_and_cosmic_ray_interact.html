        <h2>Introduction</h2>  
        <p>Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) are some of the most powerful objects in space, found at the center of galaxies. They create huge jets of energy that affect the space around them, influencing the formation of stars and even the growth of galaxies. The CAPIBARA mission is designed to detect cosmic rays (high-energy particles from space) and X-ray and ùõæ-ray emissions from AGN, helping us learn more about how these powerful jets shape the universe.</p>

    <section class="section" id="focus">
        <h2>Our Research Focus</h2>  
        <p>Our research is focused on understanding the role of AGN jets in the universe. These jets are thought to impact everything from how stars form to the movement of energy across galaxies. The CAPIBARA mission will compare its observations of cosmic rays and high-energy light with simulations of AGN jets, allowing us to learn more about how these powerful jets contribute to cosmic ray populations and the high-energy background of the universe.</p>
        <p>Our main goal is to explore how AGN jets interact with the space around them, especially when it comes to producing cosmic rays and high-energy light. By modeling AGN jets and comparing the results with CAPIBARA‚Äôs real data, we can get a better understanding of these interactions and how they might impact the development of galaxies.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="section" id="methods">
        <h2>Methods and Tools</h2>
        <p>To study AGN jets, we use a tool called the SWIFT simulation code, which allows us to create computer models of these jets in action. With SWIFT, we can simulate the power and movement of AGN jets and compare them to CAPIBARA‚Äôs observations. This helps us understand the big picture: how AGN jets affect cosmic rays and the space around them.</p>
