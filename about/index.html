            <h2>About the CAPIBARA Collaboration</h2>
            <p><strong>We are an international, student-led initiative building the next generation of space observatories.</strong> Our mission is to advance high-energy astrophysics while creating a vertically-integrated training platform for the next generation of scientists and engineers. Through hands-on development of real space hardware and open collaboration, we are proving that students can contribute meaningfully to cutting-edge scientific discovery.</p>

            <p>The collaboration operates two parallel programs: <strong>CAPIBARA-CRD</strong>, developing a cosmic ray detector for near-Earth space weather monitoring to fly on the OBA FARADAY satellite, and <strong>CAPIBARA-COSMOS</strong>, our flagship effort to build a scalable gamma-ray/X-ray satellite constellation. COSMOS follows a deliberate growth path—starting with a single CubeSat pathfinder, advancing to a dual-satellite demonstrator for triangulation, and culminating in an operational network of four observatories by 2035.</p>

            <p>We are more than a project; we are building a lasting model for student-led research. Every design document, simulation, and hardware prototype is developed collaboratively across universities worldwide, creating both scientific instruments and the skilled workforce to operate them. <strong>No experience required—only passion and willingness to learn.</strong> Join us in reshaping how space science can be done from the ground up.</p>
