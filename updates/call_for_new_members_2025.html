        <div class="article-content">
            <p>After one year of development and planning, we are thrilled to announce a call for new collaboration members. This is a volunteer opportunity open to students of all levels (high school to PhD) and fields—not just STEM, but also outreach, art, and social media. We welcome diverse roles—from STEM researchers to social media managers and outreach communicators. Read on to learn more!</p>

            <h2>Requirements</h2>
            <ul class="styled-list">
                <li>Strong English communication (oral/written) is required for collaboration and outreach.</li>
                <li>Be a Student from any level-from high school to PhD. CAPIBARA sends a strong message since it is fully run by students, and originally founded by high schoolers.</li>
                <li>Be curious and interested in a field(s). You don't have to contribute any expertise or know your field of study, but we recommend having an interest to pursue. Plus, it doesn't need to be STEM (astrophysics, physics, geophysics; mechanical, aerospace, electronic, software engineering, etc.), we are also looking for artists, social media creators, outreach writters...</li>
                <li>Be motivated and passionate in pursuing this project. Members have different levels of commitment subject to their personal lives, but you should have a minimum time to interact with the community. Members typically dedicate 1-6 hours/week, but you can work at your own path corresponding with your status (e.g., exams, thesis writing, etc.).</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Recommended, but <b>NOT required at all</b>: strong academic record, experience in a specific field, GitHub/coding knowledge</p>
            <p>If you don't know any or some of the previous skills, don't worry; you will learn them by us!</p>

            <h2>Steps to Apply</h2>
            <p>There is no selection process if you are interested you get a job. The steps for contacting us are the following:</p>

            <div class="article-highlight">

                    <li>You'll receive an email with information about joining our <a href="https://github.com/capibara3">GitHub</a> (getting access to private repositories) and regular meetings. We will also ask for additional information for the <a href="../team/">website</a> (optional).</li>
                    <li>Once you've joined, you are free to work on your tasks, both assigned and self-promoted. Plus, you can always count on other members to get help and support.</li>
                </ol>
            </div>
