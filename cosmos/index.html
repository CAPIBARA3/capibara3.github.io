                <h2>Mission Overview</h2>
                <p>CAPIGX is a student-led mission aiming to monitoring the sky for high energy transient phenomena. Sensitive in the X-ray and Gamma-ray regime, it will consist of a constellation of 3 CubeSats, enabling sub-arcminute source localisation precision. By providing rapid and precise observations of transient phenomena, such as Gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) or X-ray flashes, it will be a useful resource for the astrophysical community. It will allow follow-up observations to gravitational event alerts and monitor the sky for other transients, thus aiding the schedule of flagship missions.</p>

                <h2>Unique Value</h2>
                <p>Specially unique to this mission is its educational value, since both CAPIGX and the CAPIBARA Collaboration are fully student-led. It fosters collaboration between education and professionals and bridges the gap between school and current research. Furthermore, it creates hands-on experience for young students passionate about fields ranging from electrical and aerospace engineering to computer science and theoretical astrophysics. At the same time, the mission will provide valuable data by continuously monitoring the high energy sky.</p>

                <h2>Key Innovation</h2>
                By deploying an array of 3 different CubeSats with a baseline distance, we aim to perform very high precision localisation of burst sources through triangulation and, potentially, intensity interferometry. Building up from technology already developed and tested by the interplanetary network (IPN) and the HERMES mission, our goal is to provide sub-arcminute precision for the next era of gravitational wave observatories in the late 2030s. The issue this setup solves is that gamma-ray and X-ray are impossible to focus with regular optics like telescopes. Triangulation with multiple detectors will allow for accurate host galaxy identification and ground-based telescope follow-up observations at lower wavelengths.

                <h2>Instruments</h2>
                <p>To cover the observational gap in the keV to MeV range, we need to combine X-ray and gamma-ray instruments with segmentation at 150 keV.</p>

            <h2>Why Does It Matter?</h2>
            <p>Monitoring high-energy transient phenomena is vital for real-time alerts to the scientific community about gamma-ray bursts, magnetar bursts, AGN, and other rapid events, enabling a fast response and observation. Its unprecedented angular resolution allows precise mapping of gamma-ray sources, enhancing our understanding of the universe. Studying extreme environments near black holes, neutron stars, and active galaxies provides insights into fundamental cosmic processes, advancing our knowledge of the unvierse's msot powerful and mysterious phenomena.</p>
