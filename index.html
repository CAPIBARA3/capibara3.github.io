        <h3>What Is CAPIBARA and What We Aim For</h3>
        <p>CAPIBARA is a collaboration of young students with the aim to explore the high-energy Universe it all its facets, including ionic and photonic radiation. We propose two space missions to explore cosmic rays (ionic) and gamma/X-rays (photonic) and advance our understanding of the high energy astrophysical phenomena, quantum and particle physics, and Earthâ€™s physics. Furthermore, we aim to boost these fields and research making our data public and inspiring other young students to have an active role in research.</p>
        <p>We have applied to the <a href="https://spark-program.pldspace.com">SPARK program</a> by <a href="https://pldspace.com/en/">PLD Space</a>, which gives the opportunity to students and schools to launch their satellite with their <a href="https://pldspace.com/en/miura-5">Miura 5</a> rocket.</p>

        <h3>Missions</h3>
        <p>We have a dual goal (ionic and photonic radiation), each with specific characteristics, challenges, and needs. To optimize and have the best science quality possible, CAPIBARA is currently developing two missions.</p>

                <p>This mission will focus on the goal of detecting cosmic rays, the ionic high-energy radiation. It will feature a particle detector capable of detecting protons and alpha-particles, which account for the 97% of the cosmic ray particles in Earth orbit.</p>

                <p>This mission will focus on the goal of observing the light emission of the high-energy Universe. It will have a wide-field gamma-ray detector (1-10,000 MeV) for detecting high-energy transients, as well as an X_ray observatory for rapid follow-up observations. This will be the first mission to incorporate gamma-ray and X-ray transient monitoring in the same satellite and will proof the concept of intensity interferometry for high-energy transient localization.</p>

    <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
    <div class="faq-item">
        <div class="faq-question">What is CAPIBARA? Who is involved? <span class="faq-toggle">&#x25BC;</span></div>
        <div class="faq-answer">CAPIBARA is a scientific collaboration focused on studying the high-energy universe through two space missions. It brings together young students working to understand the cosmos using ions (cosmic rays) and photons (gamma/X-rays).</div>
    </div>
    <div class="faq-item">
        <div class="faq-question">Why do we need two missions? <span class="faq-toggle">&#x25BC;</span></div>
        <div class="faq-answer">Different cosmic messengers (ions and photons) provide complementary information about high-energy astrophysical events. In addition, separating the goals makes it more manageable to optimize each mission for its detectors and needs.</div>
    </div>
    <div class="faq-item">
        <div class="faq-question">Why do we need space missions instead of ground-based telescopes? <span class="faq-toggle">&#x25BC;</span></div>
        <div class="faq-answer">Earth's atmosphere blocks many high-energy particles and photons. Ground-based detectors study some cosmic rays, but space missions allow us to directly detect these signals without atmospheric interference.</div>
    </div>
    <div class="faq-item">
        <div class="faq-question">How do young students contribute to CAPIBARA? <span class="faq-toggle">&#x25BC;</span></div>
        <div class="faq-answer">The organization is fully integrated and run by young students in every aspect. At CAPIBARA, we want to show what young researchers are capable of and encourage other students to have an active role in science and research. Science isn't just for some, it's for all!</div>
    </div>
    <div class="faq-item">
        <div class="faq-question">How can these missions teach us about the Universe? <span class="faq-toggle">&#x25BC;</span></div>
